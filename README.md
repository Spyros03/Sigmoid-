# Sigmoid-Curve-Calculator

This matlab program was created wihtin the subject of Computer Based Soutions 
of NTUA's School of Civil Engineering.


The program uses an algorithm to calculate the most optimal solution for 
a sigmoid curve given the radius of two cricles and the distance between the cetners.
This sigmoid curve also complies with the road regulations as this curve is 
supposed to resemble a road curve.

The program does not have a UI but communicates with the user with specific .dat
files that the user provides through in-build matlab dialog boxes.

It is also provided with error checking and informs if no solution is found.

The code unfortunally is not readable because the variables and the function 
names are in greek due to the fact that it was created for school and in 
order to have better communication through the contributors. There is also
a slide presetntation of the program unfortuanlly also in greek.

To execute the program load the files in Matlab (or any other similar
software Octave etc.) add them to the load path and run the
omada2thema23.m file.

This program was a team effort of: Athina Nikolaou
                                   Spyridon Nikolaou
                                   Isidoros Tsoukalas


THE PROGRAM WAS CREATED FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES AND THERE MIGHT BE ERRORS !!
